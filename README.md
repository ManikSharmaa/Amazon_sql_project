# **Amazon Sales Analysis Project**


---

## **Project Overview**

I have worked on analyzing a dataset of over 20,000 sales records from an Amazon-like e-commerce platform. This project involves extensive querying of customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends using PostgreSQL. Through this project, I have tackled various SQL problems, including revenue analysis, customer segmentation, and inventory management.

The project also focuses on **data cleaning, handling null values, and solving real-world business problems** using structured queries.

An ERD diagram is included to visually represent the database schema and relationships between tables.

## **Database Setup & Design**

![ERD](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cf45ddf-53a6-4687-aaa8-787990042e50)

### **Schema Structure**

```sql
create table category(
	category_id	int primary key,
	category_name varchar(20)
);


create table customers(
	customer_id int primary key,
	first_name varchar(20),
	last_name varchar(20),
	state varchar(20),
	address varchar(5) default ('xxxx')
);

create table sellers(
	seller_id int primary key,
	seller_name varchar(25),
	origin varchar(10)
	);

create table products(
	product_id int primary key,
	product_name varchar(50),
	price float ,
	cogs float,
	category_id int,
	constraint product_fk_category foreign key(category_id) references category(category_id) 
);

create table orders(
	order_id int primary key,
	order_date date,
	customer_id int,
	seller_id int,
	order_status varchar(20),
	constraint orders_fk_customers foreign key(customer_id) references customers(customer_id),
	constraint orders_fk_sellers foreign key(seller_id) references sellers(seller_id)
); 

create table order_items(
	order_item_id int primary key,
	order_id int,
	product_id int, 
	quantity int,
	price_per_unit int,
	constraint orders_item_fk_products foreign key(product_id) references products(product_id),
	constraint orders_item_fk_orders foreign key(order_id) references orders(order_id)
);

create table payments(
	payment_id int primary key,
	order_id int,
	payment_date date,
	payment_status varchar(30),
	constraint payments_fk_orders foreign key(order_id) references orders(order_id)
);

create table shippings(
	shipping_id int primary key,
	order_id int,
	shipping_date date,
	return_date date,
	shipping_providers varchar(20),
	delivery_status varchar(15),
	constraint shippings_fk_orders foreign key(order_id) references orders(order_id)
);

create table inventory(
	inventory_id int primary key,
	product_id int,
	stock int,
	warehouse_id int,
	last_stock_date date,
	constraint inventory_fk_products foreign key(product_id) references products(product_id)

);

```

## **Task: Data Cleaning**

I cleaned the dataset by:
- **Removing duplicates**: Duplicates in the customer and order tables were identified and removed.
- **Handling missing values**: Null values in critical fields (e.g., customer address, payment status) were either filled with default values or handled using appropriate methods.

---

## **Handling Null Values**

Null values were handled based on their context:
- **Customer addresses**: Missing addresses were assigned default placeholder values.
- **Payment statuses**: Orders with null payment statuses were categorized as “Pending.”
- **Shipping information**: Null return dates were left as is, as not all shipments are returned.

---

## **Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to showcase SQL proficiency through complex queries that address real-world e-commerce business challenges. The analysis covers various aspects of e-commerce operations, including:
- Customer behavior
- Sales trends
- Inventory management
- Payment and shipping analysis
- Forecasting and product performance
  

## **Identifying Business Problems**

Key business problems identified:
1. Low product availability due to inconsistent restocking.
2. High return rates for specific product categories.
3. Significant delays in shipments and inconsistencies in delivery times.
4. High customer acquisition costs with a low customer retention rate.

---

## **Solving Business Problems**

### Solutions Implemented:

Create a stored procedure that, when a product is sold, performs the following actions:
Inserts a new sales record into the orders and order_items tables.
Updates the inventory table to reduce the stock based on the product and quantity purchased.
The procedure should ensure that the stock is adjusted immediately after recording the sale.

```SQL

create or replace procedure add_sales(
	p_order_id int,
	p_customer_id int,
	p_seller_id int,
	p_order_item_id int,
	p_product_id int, 
	p_quantity int
	)

language plpgsql
as $$

declare
	
	v_stock int;
	v_price float;
	v_product_name varchar(100);
	
begin

	select price, product_name
	into v_price, v_product_name
	from products
	where product_id = p_product_id;
	
	select 
		count(*)
		into 
		v_stock
	from inventory
	where product_id = p_product_id and stock>= p_quantity;

	if v_stock>0 then 
	
		--inserting values
		insert into orders(order_id, order_date, customer_id, seller_id) 
		values(p_order_id, current_date, p_customer_id, p_seller_id);

		insert into order_items(order_item_id, order_id, product_id, quantity, price_per_unit, total_sale)
			values(p_order_item_id, p_order_id, p_product_id,p_quantity, v_price, v_price* p_quantity);

			
		--inserting values

		update inventory
		set stock = stock - p_quantity
		where product_id = p_product_id;

		raise notice 'Thankyou Product: % sale has been added into the orders and order_items table. 
					   Also inventory table is also updated ', v_product_name;

	else
		raise notice 'Thankyou for your info. Your product is not available. ';

	end if;
	
end;

$$


```
